# reports-automatization
Multiple scripts that I currently use in my job for the automatization of analytical reports.

## Run

- install all dependencies with command: ```pipenv install```
- run the script you need

## Reports

Basically all the reports are being compiled with web scrapping data from the platform, processing it
and further filling in data to the xlsx files.
